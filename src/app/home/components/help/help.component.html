    priorities and the responsibilities for the tasks. It uses Kanban as a
    method from agile project management. The goal is to ideally distribute the
    work to be done and the available capacities. The most important element of
    this method is the Kanban Board. This is divided into different work phases.
    <br /><br />Additionally, Join offers the possibility to add new contacts
    under the Contacts tab.
